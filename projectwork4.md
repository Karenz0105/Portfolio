## Aim

The aim for this weeks entry of the portfolio is to finish the selected user story from the previous week.

## Issue Working On

The user story I am working on is a continuation from last week, which was the user story "As an UNDAC Team Support and Logistics Manager, I want to assign vehicles and other equipment to operations on request so that assignments are appropriately equipped."

The goal for this user story is to have a section of the program that will allow UNDAC Team Support and Logistics Manager users to view operations and assign equipment and vehicles.

The main criteria for this user story is :

* Operations can be viewed in a list
* New requests will be highlighted in the list
* List filters can be cleared
* Operations details can be viewed
* Requests can be approved

## Progress from Previous Week

Compared to last week I have the issue much more complete. It doesn't meet all the criteria that the user story wanted, but that is because I do not know how to get some of those things to work using .NET Maui. Such as the highlighting of new requests in a list.
