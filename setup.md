# Setting Up a Personal Development Enviroment


## Aim

Our aim is to set up a Personal Development Enviroment using Visual Studio.


## Downloading Enviroment

To set up a Personal Development Enviroment, we first have to select an appropriate one to use. In this case we have chosen to use Visual Studio.

We will first have to download Visual Studio which we can get from the [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) website.

![Microsoft Website](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/MicrosoftWebsite.png)

From the Microsoft website we can click on the drop down menu that says 'All Microsoft' and under the 'Developer & IT' section there will be 'Visual Studio'.

When you select 'Visual Studio', you will then be taken to the Visual Studio page where you will be able to download the program.

Elsewise, you can go to the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) website.

Within this page there will be 3 different versions of Visual Studio you can download.

Download the version of Visual Studio that is just called 'Visual Studio'. (It should be the 1st option, it also includes a Windows logo.)

When you hover over or click on the 'Download Visual Studio' button there will be 3 versions that you can download.

Select the appropriate version that you will need. In most cases the Community version will be fine.

Your download will then begin or you will be prompted on where you would like to download the program.

### Another way to acquire Visual Studio

However, if you are a student you can get the Enterprise version to use by going to [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/~/software).

You will need to enter your student email, if you have not used Azure before you may need to sign up first by using your student email.


## Installing Visual Studio

Once the program has finished downloading you can then install it.

Open the download and you will be prompted with information on installing the program. Select all the appropraite options for your use.

When installing Visual Studio you will be asked which workloads you would like to install, make sure to have selected the workload that is called '.NET Multi-platform App UI development'.

You can either download your workloads while installing Visual Studio or download them after it has been installed.

Once all has been installed you will be ready to customise your Visual Studio and use it.

## Modifying Visual Studio

If you already have Visual Studio installed but don't have the workload you need installed, then there is an easy way to install it.

![Modify Visual Studio](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/VisualStudioInstaller.png)

Firstly, open up the Visual Studio Installer and select 'Modify' on the version of Visual Studio you'd like to modify, depending if you have multiple versions installed.

![Install Workloads](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/VisualStudioInstallNet.png)

After selecting modify, you will then be able to select what workloads you would like to install into your Visual Studio.

Once your chosen workloads are selected you can install them and they will be ready to use within Visual Studio.


## Creating a Project in Visual Studio

When you first create a new project in Visual Studio, you will be prompted to select the template you wish to use.

![Visual Studio Config Settings](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/VisualStudioConfig.png)

You will then need to enter a name for your project and select a location where you would like it to be saved to.

![Visual Studio Additional Information](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/VisualStudioAdditionalInfo.png)

You will then need to select which framework you would like to use for this project.

![Visual Studio Interface](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/VisualStudioInterface.png)

Then your project will have been successfully created.


## Reflection

Setting up a Personal Development Enviroment that I was going to use for this module was an easy task.

I found it to be this way as we are going to be using Visual Studio, which I have used multiple times throughout the last few years.

I happened to already have Visual Studio installed, so all I had to do was check if I had the workload that was needed for this module installed.

The workload that we need is one called '.NET Multi-platform App UI development'.

After checking my Visual Studio, I noticed I do not have this workload installed.

So, my next task was to install it.

To do this I first went to the 'Visual Studio Installer' and looked for my version of Visual Studio which is the 2022 version.

I then selected to modify it, which allowed me to select workloads to install into my Visual Studio.

After finding the workload I needed within the list I selected to install it.

I then selected to create a new project to make sure it was properly installed and made a test project to see how it worked.

This was fairly simple and easy for me to do, as I had previous experience with this.
