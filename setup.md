# Setting Up a Personal Development Enviroment

To set up a Personal Development Enviroment, we first have to select an apporiate one to use.

In this case we have choosen to use Visual Studio.

We will first have to download Visual Studio which we can get from the Microsoft website.

From the Microsoft website we can click on the drop down menu that says "All Microsoft" and under the Developer & IT section there will be Visual Studio.
When that text is clicked on it will then open the Visual Studio page where you can download Visual Studio from.

https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com

From then on we will install the program and select which workloads we want to install with the program.
For this course we will be using C# and will need the .NET Multi-platform App UI development.

I had already installed Visual Studio, but didn't have this workload installed.

To install the workload I needed, I first opened up the Visual Studio Installer and selected 'Modify'.
This then opened an area where I could select workloads to install into my Visual Studio.
After selecting the workload, I could install it into my Visual Studio.

It is then ready to use.


## Reflection

As I had already installed Visual Studio previously I was able to skip most steps needed for installing it.
All I had to do to my Visual Studio was modify it, so that I could install the workload that was needed for this module.
