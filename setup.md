# Setting Up a Personal Development Enviroment

## Aim

Our aim is to set up a Personal Development Enviroment using Visual Studio.

## Downloading Enviroment

To set up a Personal Development Enviroment, we first have to select an appropriate one to use. In this case we have choosen to use Visual Studio.

We will first have to download Visual Studio which we can get from the [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) website.

From the Microsoft website we can click on the drop down menu that says "All Microsoft" and under the Developer & IT section there will be Visual Studio.
When that text is clicked on it will then open the Visual Studio page where you can download Visual Studio from.

Elsewise, you can just go to the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) website.

Within the Visual Studio page you can select from 3 versions to download.

We want to just install Visual Studio, so the first one that shows.
When you hover over or click on the 'Download Visual Studio' there will be 3 versions that you can download.
Select the appropriate version that you will need. In most cases the Community version will be fine.

Your download will then begin or you will be prompted on where you would like to download the program.

### Another way to acquire Visual Studio

However, if you are a student you can get the Enterprise version to use by going to [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/~/software).

## Installing Visual Studio

Once the program has finished downloading you can then install it.

Open the download and you will be prompted with information on installing the program. Select all the appropraite options for your use.

When installing Visual Studio you will be asked which workloads you would like to install, make sure to have selected the workload that is called '.NET Multi-platform App UI development'.

You can either download your workloads while installing Visual Studio or download them after it has been installed.

Once all has been installed you will be ready to customise your Visual Studio and use it.

## Modifying Visual Studio

If you already have Visual Studio installed but don't have the workload you need installed, then there is an easy way to install it.

![Modify Visual Studio](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/VisualStudioInstaller.png)

Firstly, open up the Visual Studio Installer and select 'Modify' on the version of Visual Studio you'd like to modify, depending if you have multiple versions installed.

![Install Workloads](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/VisualStudioInstallNet.png)

After selecting modify you will then be able to select what workloads you would like to install into your Visual Studio.

Once your choosen workloads are selected you can install them and they will be ready to use within Visual Studio.

From then on we will install the program and select which workloads we want to install with the program.
For this course we will be using C# and will need the .NET Multi-platform App UI development.




## Reflection

As I had already installed Visual Studio previously I was able to skip most steps needed for installing it.
All I had to do to my Visual Studio was modify it, so that I could install the workload that was needed for this module.



I had already installed Visual Studio, but didn't have this workload installed.

To install the workload I needed, I first opened up the Visual Studio Installer and selected 'Modify'.
This then opened an area where I could select workloads to install into my Visual Studio.
After selecting the workload, I could install it into my Visual Studio.

It is then ready to use.
