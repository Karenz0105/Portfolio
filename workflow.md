# Workflow


## Aim


The aim for this weeks entry is to understand and use the workflow tools within Github.


## Using Workflow Tools
  
### Accessing the Project Board

To use the workflow tools within Github we first must go into our repositry.

After going into our repositry there should be a bar with different things we can access.

![Accessing Projects](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow1.png)

We want to select the 'Projects' section.

This will then take us to a section on the website where we can create a new project.

![Creating Project](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow2.png)

When you first go onto this page there is a green button that could say either 'Link a project' or 'New project'.

If it says to 'Link a project', select the arrow at the side.

![Selecting New Project](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow3.png)

Once pressed it should open a drop down menu that will have an option to select a 'New Project'.

After selecting this the text within the green button should now say 'New Project', you can now click on the button to start creating your project.

![Selecting Template](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow5.png)

You should then be greeted with a menu to select a template for the project.

Select on 'Board' from the 'Start from scratch' section.

You should then name your project, you can also just keep the default name if you'd like. But it is recommended to name your projects so you don't lose them or forgot what they are about.

Then select the green 'Create' button at the bottom right to create your task board.
 
 
 
### Update task board

Now that we have created our task board, we should add some tasks into it.

There are 3 sections on our task board automatically, these are:
* Todo
* In Progress
* Done

We can add more sections if we would like, but these 3 should be fine for most scenarios.

![Adding Tasks to Todo](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow7.png)

To add a task we can select the '+ Add Item' at the bottom of a section.

![Enter Tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow8.png)

Once selected, the area should change to be able to write in.

![Adding Tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow9.png)

We can then enter the title for our task within this section.

Once done we can simply press the enter key to add it into the task board.

The task we created will be added into the section you created it in.

![Todo board with tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow10.png)

We can create multiple tasks and have them displayed in the section.



### Accepting a task

We will then want to accept a task, or start a task.

We firstly will need to convert the task to an issue.

There are 2 ways to do this.

![Convert to issue #1](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow11.png)

The first way we can do this is by selecting the 3 dots above the title of our task, when selected a menu will appear and at the top there will be an option saying 'Convert to issue'. select that and then there will be an option to select an item which should be the same name as your repositry. (Image below shows how it should be, even though it is another way to do it, they both get the same menu)

![Convert to issue #2](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workload11.5.png)

The second way we can convert a task to an issue is by selecting the name of the task. It will then give us a more detailed view of different things about the task. But we want to select the 'Convert to issue' area. It will then display a menu below where we can select an item. The item should be the same name as your repositry.

Once you do either of these ways, you will be able to do more with the task.

![Selecting Assignees](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow13.5.png)

To select who is doing the task, or to assign yourself to a task.

Firstly select the task you want to do by clicking on the name.

We will then have alot more things we can edit.

On the right panel we can select the 'Assignees' section and it should bring up a menu of people in your project. Select who you want to be assigned to the task, or assign yourself.



### Updating task information

Now that we have created tasks and assigned them, we can add more information to them.

![Adding Comment](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow12.png)

We can add a description or comments about the task.

We will select on the project from the section it is in by clicking the name.

Within the section it shows, we can write a description on the task. This could be a brief description or more indepth.

After writing what we need to, we can select the green 'Update comment' button to save the description.

The section below this area is where we can leave comments on the task if needed.

![Move Column](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow17.png)

We should now move our task to the 'In Progress' section of the board.

We can do this by selecting the 3 dots above the name of the task.

Within the menu it brings up we can select the 'Move to column' part.

![Select Column](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow17.5.png)

Once we select that, it will allow us to select from the 3 sections we have in the board already.

As we set this task in the 'Todo' it will have a tick next to that.

We want to select the 'In Progress' one though, as we have now started working on this task.

![Task in 'In Progress'](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow18.png)

Once we have done this, the task should now be moved into the section we selected.

We can repeat these same steps when we have completed the project to move it into the 'Done' section.



#### Alternative way

Similar to how we converted the task into an issue, we can do the same to select which section the task should be in.

For this we would just select on the tasks name, this would bring up the area that allows us to add comments and such.

On the right panel there is a part that says 'Status', we would select this and it would give us the same 3 options on which section we want the task in.

// Add screenshot for this



### Complete accepted task

// Probably say about changing the status of task to Done



### Commit changes

// Unsure what means, unless it just means saving. This section might not be needed



### Checking work against Definition of Done (DoD)

// Double check the DoD in the Github to see



### Making a pull request

// Something about pull request



## Reflection

// Probably say about tutorial and how I found creating the task board.
