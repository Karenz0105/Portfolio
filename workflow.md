# Workflow


## Aim


The aim for this weeks entry is to understand and use the workflow tools within Github.

  
## Accessing the Project Board

To use the workflow tools within Github we first must go into our repository.

After going into our repository there will be tabs for different things we can do.

![Accessing Projects](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow1.png)

We want to select the 'Projects' tab.

This will then take us to a section on the website where we can create a new project.

## Creating a Project

We can now create our project.

![Creating Project](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow2.png)

When you first go onto this page there is a green button that could say either 'Link a project' or 'New project'.

If it says to 'Link a project', select the arrow at the side.

![Selecting New Project](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow3.png)

Once pressed it should open a drop down menu that will have an option to select a 'New Project'.

After selecting this the text within the green button should now say 'New Project', you can now click on the button to start creating your project.

![Selecting Template](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow5.png)

You should then be greeted with a menu to select a template for the project.

Select on 'Board' from the 'Start from scratch' section.

You should then name your project, you can also just keep the default name if you'd like. But it is recommended to name your projects so you don't lose them or forgot what they are about.

Then select the green 'Create' button at the bottom right to create your task board.
 
 
 
## Update task board

Now that we have created our task board, we should add some tasks into it.

There are 3 sections on our task board automatically, these are:
* Todo
* In Progress
* Done

We can add more sections if we would like, but these 3 should be fine for most scenarios.

![Adding Tasks to Todo](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow7.png)

To add a task we can select the '+ Add Item' at the bottom of a section.

![Enter Tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow8.png)

Once selected, the area should change to be able to write in.

![Adding Tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow9.png)

We can then enter the title for our task within this section.

Once done we can simply press the enter key to add it into the task board.

The task we created will be added into the section you created it in.

![Todo board with tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow10.png)

We can create multiple tasks and have them displayed in the section.



## Convert task to issue

We will then want to accept a task, or start a task.

We firstly will need to convert the task to an issue.

There are 2 ways to do this.

![Convert to issue #1](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow11.png)

The first way we can do this is by selecting the 3 dots above the title of our task, when selected a menu will appear and at the top there will be an option saying 'Convert to issue'. select that and then there will be an option to select an item which should be the same name as your repository. 

// Add screenshot of the select an item

![Convert to issue #2](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workload11.5.png)

The second way we can convert a task to an issue is by selecting the name of the task. It will then give us a more detailed view of different things about the task. But we want to select the 'Convert to issue' area. It will then display a menu below where we can select an item. The item should be the same name as your repository.

## Accepting a task

We can now select who will be doing the task.

This is done by selecting the task you want to assign somebody to.

![Selecting Assignees](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow13.5.png)



After selecting a task, there will be a section within the tasks interface where you can assign somebody.

Select on the 'Assignees' part and a menu will appear that shows other people within the project.

Select either yourself or somebody else to assign to the task.


## Updating task information

Now that we have created tasks and assigned them, we can add more information to them.

![Adding Comment](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow12.png)

Within the tasks interface we can add a description or add comments about the task.

After inputting information into the description part of the task, we can select the 'Update comment' button to commit the changes about the task.

We can also add comments in the section belon if needed.

## Updating task status

We should now move our task to the 'In Progress' section of the board.

![Move Column](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow17.png)

We can do this by selecting the 3 dots above the name of the task.

A menu will appear, within this menu there will be a part that says 'Move to column. We will want to select this.

![Select Column](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow17.5.png)

Once selected, we will get options on what section we want to move the task into.

The task, depending on where you added it, should already have a tick.

But we will want to move the task from the section it is already in, into another one.

Our task is currently in the 'Todo' section, but we will want to have it in the 'In Progress' section.

To do this we will simply just click on the 'In Progress' option in the menu.

![Task in 'In Progress'](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow18.png)

Once we have done this, the task should now be moved into the section we selected.

We can repeat these same steps when we have completed the project to move it into the 'Done' section.



### Alternative way

Similar to how we converted the task into an issue, we can do the same to select which section the task should be in.

For this we would just select on the tasks name, this would bring up the task interface.

Within the interface, on the right side there is a part that says 'Status'. We can click on this to get the options on which section the task will be in.

// Add screenshot for this



## Complete accepted task

Once we have completed the current task we are working on, we can then move the task into the 'Done' section.

This helps to show us what tasks we have already completed.

// Screenshot of task in Done section



## Commit changes

// Unsure what means, unless it just means saving. This section might not be needed



## Checking work against Definition of Done (DoD)

// Double check the DoD in the Github to see



## Making a pull request

// Something about pull request



## Reflection

// Probably say about tutorial and how I found creating the task board.
