# Workflow


## Aim

The aim for this weeks entry is to understand and use the workflow tools within Github.


  
## Accessing the Project Board

To use the workflow tools within Github we first must go into our repository.

After going into our repository there will be tabs for different things we can do.

![Accessing Projects](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow1.png)

We want to select the 'Projects' tab.

This will then take us to a section on the website where we can create a new project.



## Creating a Project

We can now create our project.

![Creating Project](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow2.png)

When you first go onto this page there is a green button that could say either 'Link a project' or 'New project'.

If it says to 'Link a project', select the arrow at the side.

![Selecting New Project](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow3.png)

Once pressed it should open a drop down menu that will have an option to select a 'New Project'.

After selecting this the text within the green button should now say 'New Project', you can now click on the button to start creating your project.

![Selecting Template](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow5.png)

You should then be greeted with a menu to select a template for the project.

Select on 'Board' from the 'Start from scratch' section.

You should then name your project, you can also just keep the default name if you'd like. But it is recommended to name your projects so you don't lose them or forgot what they are about.

Then select the green 'Create' button at the bottom right to create your task board.
 
 
 
## Updating the Task Board

Now that we have created our task board, we should add some tasks into it.

There are 3 sections on our task board automatically, these are:

* Todo
* In Progress
* Done

We can add more sections if we would like, but these 3 should be fine for most scenarios.

![Adding Tasks to Todo](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow7.png)

To add a task we can select the '+ Add Item' at the bottom of a section.

![Enter Tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow8.png)

Once selected, the area should change to be able to write in.

![Adding Tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow9.png)

We can then enter the title for our task within this section.

Once done we can simply press the enter key to add it into the task board.

The task we created will be added into the section you created it in.

![Todo board with tasks](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow10.png)

We can create multiple tasks and have them displayed in the section.



## Convert Task to Issue

We will then want to accept a task, or start a task.

We firstly will need to convert the task to an issue.

There are 2 ways to do this.

![Convert to issue #1](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow11.png)

The first way we can do this is by selecting the 3 dots above the title of our task, when selected a menu will appear and at the top there will be an option saying 'Convert to issue'.

![Select item for issue](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow19.png)

Once that has been selected, another menu will appear that will say to select an item. The item within this menu should be the same name as your repository.

![Convert to issue #2](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workload11.5.png)

The second way we can convert a task to an issue is by selecting the name of the task. It will then give us a more detailed view of different things about the task. But we want to select the 'Convert to issue' area. It will then display a menu below where we can select an item. The item should be the same name as your repository.



## Accepting a Task

We can now select who will be doing the task.

This is done by selecting the task you want to assign somebody to.

![Selecting Assignees](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow13.5.png)

After selecting a task, there will be a section within the tasks interface where you can assign somebody.

Select on the 'Assignees' part and a menu will appear that shows other people within the project.

Select either yourself or somebody else to assign to the task.


## Updating Task Information

Now that we have created tasks and assigned them, we can add more information to them.

![Adding Comment](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow12.png)

Within the tasks interface we can add a description or add comments about the task.

After inputting information into the description part of the task, we can select the 'Update comment' button to commit the changes about the task.

We can also add comments in the section belon if needed.



## Updating Task Status

We should now move our task to the 'In Progress' section of the board.

![Move Column](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow17.png)

We can do this by selecting the 3 dots above the name of the task.

A menu will appear, within this menu there will be a part that says 'Move to column. We will want to select this.

![Select Column](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow17.5.png)

Once selected, we will get options on what section we want to move the task into.

The task, depending on where you added it, should already have a tick.

But we will want to move the task from the section it is already in, into another one.

Our task is currently in the 'Todo' section, but we will want to have it in the 'In Progress' section.

To do this we will simply just click on the 'In Progress' option in the menu.



### Alternative way

Similar to how we converted the task into an issue, we can do the same to select which section the task should be in.

For this we would just select on the tasks name, this would bring up the task interface.

![Changing Status](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow20.png)

Within the interface, on the right side there is a part that says 'Status'. We can click on this to get the options on which section the task will be in.

The task status will says which section it is already in.

For our task, it currently is within the 'Todo' section, so we shall select the 'In Progress' section to have the status of the task changed.



### Task Status Changed

![Task in 'In Progress'](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow18.png)

Once one of the ways to change a task status has been done, the task will then appear within the section that was selected.



## Creating a Branch for Accepted Task

When we want to work on a task from the task board and have assigned it to ourselves or have been assigned it, it is a good idea to create a new branch.

This is because it allows us to work on the task seperately from the main project.



### Accessing Tasks

![Selecting task](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow21.png)

From the tabs in our repository, we want to select the 'Issues' one.

After doing so, we can see all current tasks that we have.

Click on the task you want to create a branch for.



### Creating Branch

A page should then load showing information about the task, it will show information about any changes made.

![Create branch](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow22.png)

On the right side of the page there is a section called 'Development'

Underneath there is blue text saying 'Create a branch'

Click on this text.

![Create branch interface](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Workflow23.png)

We will then get an interface that allows us to create our branch for the task.

We can set a name for the branch, select the destination and choose how we open the branch.

Once all options have been filled out we can then create our branch by clicking the 'Create branch' button.


### Creating a File in New Branch

Once the new branch has been created we can now edit other files within the branch or add new items.

![New File](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow30.png)

If we create a new file within the branch, it will only appear there and won't appear in the main branch until we save it to be there.


## Commit Changes

Once we have made all the changes we want to make within the branch we can commit the changes.

![Commit changes](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow31.png)

There are multiple commiting changes we can do, we can :

* Commit changes to just save the information within the branch
* Commit changes and push the changes to the main branch
* Commit changes and syncs changes to your local repository
* Commit changes and create a pull request

You should select the most appropriate one based on what you need it for.



## Checking Work against Definition of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done (DoD) is a checklist that is good to use when comparing your work if you want to release the changes.

There are multiple things that can be on the checklist, it is to be used as a guide to know if your changes within the branch are ready to be incoporated into the main branch.

Things that may be on a Definition of Done (DoD) checklist include :

* All acceptance criteria has been achieved
* Unit Tests are more than 80% complete
* Testing has passed, esspically functional testing
* There is no know bugs, errors or defects
* Documentiation of what has been done so far is up to date



## Making a Pull Request

We can now create a pull request.

Pull requests are used to have other members in your team look over you work to see if it is fine to be marged into the main branch.



### New Pull Request

![New Pull Request](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow32.png)

To create a pull request we first select on the 'Pull requests' tab within our repository.

Within this section we can select the 'New pull request' button.



### Creating Pull Request

![Creating Pull Request](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow33.png)

We will then get a page that will allow us to select which branch our pull request is about, once we select our branch we can select the 'Create pull request' button.



### Viewing Pull Requests

We can now look at what pull requests we have by selecting the 'Pull requests' tab again.

![Pull request list](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow35.png)

Within this section, any pull requests that have been made will be displayed.

We can view these by selecting the name of the pull request.

![Info on Pull Request](https://github.com/Karenz0105/Portfolio/blob/main/images/workflow36.png)

The information about the pull request will now be displayed, we can view the comments and changes that have been made.

If there has been any updates between the branch and the main it will tell us about it, so that we can merge the branches or new items within the branches together.

We can leave a comment about the pull request that has been made.

We can also close the pull request.




## Reflection

Using and creating items within Github using the workflow tools was a little challenging.

I found it to be this way, as I have not really used Github before.

It eventually became easier to understand as I went on creating items.

Creating and operating the task board was pretty easy to do, it is also a very handy tool to help keep track of tasks to be done and what has been done.

Working with the branches and pull requests was a little difficult but I eventually got the hang of it.

I learned quite alot about Github this week, which is very handy for future use.
