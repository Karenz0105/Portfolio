# Project Work 1

## Aim

Over the next few weeks our aim is to complete a section of code based off a selected user story.

## Issue working on

The issue I have chose to work on is the user story ;

"As an UNDAC Deputy Team Leader I want to view details of all team partners so that I can contact them immediately"

The idea behind this user story is that the Deputy Team Leader will be able to view the contact information about team partners.
